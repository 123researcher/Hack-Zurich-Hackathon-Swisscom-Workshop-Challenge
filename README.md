## Hack-Zurich-Hackathon-Swisscom-Workshop-Challenge

What a year 2020 has been so far! People's mobility, habits and priorities have been turned upside down, impacting economy and social life. 
 Can you leverage Swisscom data and help our society navigate through this crisis? Businesses need to better understand how their customers' habits have changed. 
 Which areas were the most impacted and could they reach a larger public by relocating their stores? At the same time, we want the population to stay safe. 
 Is it possible to predict crowded areas and recommend personalised alternatives like similar points of interest or a different time of the day? 
 We will provide you with historical data of mobility and population density across the territory of major Swiss cities as measured by network activity. 
Feel free to combine our data with open-source datasets that could improve and enrich your recommendations.

# Idea for this challenge
This app will help to reduce crowd at various places for maintaing safety during this crisis/covid pandemic. 
We are building an AI chatbot using rasa framework, where  User will put the data such as visiting place at which time frame. Then we will store it into excel form inside the backend of
chatbot. Then we will use this data provided by the users to suggest the alternative 
 
 if a new user will say the bot  - " I am going to Park A at 5pm"
 Bot  will fetch the data and check how many people are present at Park A at 5pm.
 Bot will recommend similar points of interest or a different time frame
